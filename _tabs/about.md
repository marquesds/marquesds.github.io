Hello 👋🏾 my name is Lucas Marques. I'm a Software Engineer working 10+ years for, mostly with payments and integrations. I'm christian, married, and trying to have a baby 👶🏽. Currently, I'm learning more about data (architecture, engineering, math, machine learning, and so on). I created this blog to share a few thoughts and, eventually, make a knowledge dump, so I can resort to it every time I need to remember something. Few free to add me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marquesds/){:target="_blank"}, and follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lmarquesds){:target="_blank"}, and [Github](https://github.com/marquesds){:target="_blank"}.
